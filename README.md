# Telegram Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project I collected all of my Telegram messaging data, and then performed analysis answering some interesting questions. The main results of the analysis can be seen in [2_eda.ipynb](https://github.com/74R45/telegram-dialogs-analysis-v2/blob/main/2_eda.ipynb) in the section named "Homework #6".

This is the course project for Computational Social Science 2022 course.

See [telegram_eda_presentation.pdf](telegram_eda_presentation.pdf) if you want to quickly get an idea of my final results and the steps I took to achieve them.
